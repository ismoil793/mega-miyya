# GitHub App Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a GitHub App so that AI review comments are posted under the bot's name instead of your personal account.

## 🎯 Why GitHub App?

- **Bot Identity**: Comments appear under the bot's name (e.g., "mega-miyya-bot commented")
- **Professional Appearance**: Clear separation between human and AI comments
- **Better UX**: Users know immediately it's an automated review
- **Dynamic Installation**: Automatically detects installation IDs for each repository

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub App

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps)
2. Click "New GitHub App"
3. Fill in the details:

```
App name: mega-miyya
Description: AI-powered code review bot
Homepage URL: http://localhost:3004
Webhook URL: http://localhost:3004/api/webhooks/github
Webhook secret: [use the same as GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET]
```

**Important:** The webhook URL is configured at the GitHub App level and will automatically receive events for all repositories where the app is installed. No need to configure webhooks per repository!

### 2. Set Permissions

**Repository permissions:**
- `Issues`: Read & Write (for commenting on PRs)
- `Pull requests`: Read & Write (for reading PR data)
- `Contents`: Read (for reading code files)
- `Metadata`: Read (for repository info)

**Subscribe to events:**
- `Pull requests`
- `Issues` (optional, for future features)

### 3. Install the App

1. After creating, click "Install App"
2. Choose which repositories to install it on
3. **No need to note the Installation ID** - the app will detect it automatically!

### 4. Generate Private Key

1. In your GitHub App settings, click "Generate private key"
2. Download the `.pem` file
3. Convert it to a single line for environment variable:

```bash
# Convert the .pem file to a single line
cat your-app.private-key.pem | tr '\n' '\\n'
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# GitHub App Configuration (for bot comments)
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
GITHUB_APP_NAME=mega-miyya
# GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID is no longer needed - detected automatically!
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Current Flow (OAuth Only):
1. User connects with OAuth → Gets personal access token
2. Webhook triggers → Uses personal token to post comments
3. Comments appear under **user's name**

### New Flow (OAuth + GitHub App):
1. User connects with OAuth → Gets personal access token (for reading)
2. Webhook triggers → Uses personal token to read repository data
3. **Uses GitHub App** to post comments:
   - Automatically detects installation ID for the repository
   - Generates installation token dynamically
   - Posts comment as bot
4. Comments appear under **bot's name**

### Fallback Behavior:
- If GitHub App is not configured → Falls back to personal token
- If GitHub App fails → Falls back to personal token
- Always logs which method is being used

## 🧪 Testing

### 1. Check Configuration

The app will log the GitHub App configuration:

```
🤖 Using GitHub App for bot comments...
🔧 GitHub App config: { appId: 'configured', privateKey: 'configured' }
✅ Got installation token for owner/repo
✅ Bot comment posted to PR #5 in username/repo
```

### 2. Test Fallback

If GitHub App is not configured:

```
👤 GitHub App not configured, using personal token...
🔧 GitHub App config: { appId: 'missing', privateKey: 'missing' }
✅ Personal comment posted to PR #5 in username/repo
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GitHub App ID or Private Key not configured"**
   - Check that `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` are set
   - Make sure the private key is properly formatted with `\n` for newlines

2. **"Failed to get installation ID"**
   - Check that the app is installed on the repository
   - Ensure the app has the required permissions
   - Verify the repository owner has granted access to the app

3. **"GitHub App failed, falling back to personal token"**
   - This is normal fallback behavior
   - Check the logs for the specific error
   - Verify the app permissions and installation

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if GitHub App is configured
node -e "const { githubAppService } = require('./src/lib/github-app'); console.log(githubAppService.getConfig());"

# Test JWT generation
node -e "const { githubAppService } = require('./src/lib/github-app'); console.log(githubAppService.isConfigured());"

# List all installations for your app
node find-installation-id.js
```

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Professional Appearance**: Comments clearly marked as AI-generated
- **User Experience**: No confusion about who posted the comment
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple repositories with different installations
- **Reliability**: Fallback to personal token if GitHub App fails
- **Dynamic Detection**: No need to manage installation IDs manually
- **Future-Proof**: Works even if app is reinstalled or moved to different repos

## 🔄 Migration

The system is designed to work with or without the GitHub App:

- **With GitHub App**: Comments posted as bot
- **Without GitHub App**: Comments posted as user (current behavior)

You can set up the GitHub App at any time without breaking existing functionality.
